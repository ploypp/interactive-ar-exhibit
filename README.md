# Interactive AR Exhibit

This project is a Snapchatâ€™s AR filter that combines AI-generated art with a question-based game, aiming to explore the interpretation of AI on the question: What does it mean to be alive? This GitHub repository does not include all meterials used in the Snap's AR Software, Lens Studio; however, it provides coding scripts used in the projects.
